<h2> 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard — Project Description </h2>
<p>The HR Analytics Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project developed in Tableau that helps HR professionals and business stakeholders explore key workforce metrics and derive actionable insights from human resources data.<br>
This dashboard centralizes vital HR information into a single, interactive interface — allowing users to monitor trends, compare segments, and analyze workforce dynamics visually. It integrates a range of visual analytics to provide both high-level summaries and detailed breakdowns of important HR indicators.<br>
Key components of the dashboard typically include: </p>
🔹 High-Level KPIs <br>
Summary cards showing core metrics such as total number of employees, attrition count, attrition rate, active workforce, and average employee age. These metrics offer an at-a-glance view of overall workforce health and trends.<br>
🔹 Employee Demographics & Segmentation <br>
Interactive visualizations that break down the workforce by characteristics such as gender and age groups. These charts help identify patterns in composition and movement within the organization.<br>
🔹 Attrition Insights<br>
Visual exploration of employee turnover across dimensions like department, role category, education level, and demographic segments. This helps uncover where attrition is highest and may highlight areas for targeted retention strategies.<br>
🔹 Satisfaction & Engagement Indicators <br>
Many dashboards include analyses of job satisfaction or engagement scores — for example using heatmaps or bar charts — to show where employee satisfaction is high or low and how it correlates with other HR metrics.<br>
🔹 Interactivity & Filtering <br>
Users can filter views by department, gender, age band, and other attributes to explore trends in specific subsets of the workforce. Filters and tooltips enhance user experience and allow for customized, scenario-specific analysis.<br>
<h2>🎯 Purpose and Impact</h2>
The core goal of the HR Analytics Dashboard is to enable data-driven decision-making in HR functions — such as improving employee retention, understanding workforce composition, identifying risk areas, and supporting strategic planning. By turning raw HR data into clear visual stories, the dashboard empowers HR teams to quickly spot patterns and communicate insights to business leaders
